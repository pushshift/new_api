after:
    description: |
        This parameter can be used to limit the date range of returned results. This parameter will accept multiple types of values.  
        If a number is passed, it treats the value as an epoch second timestamp. If a number is followed by 's,m,h,d' (seconds, minutes, hours, days) 
        it calculates the amount of time for you.  For example, to return all returns within the past three days, you can pass after=3d which
        translates to "everything after 3 days ago." Finally, you can pass an ISO-6801 formatted string in a date (YYYY-MM-DD) or 
        datetime (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS) format. For example, to return everything after January 1, 2015, you can use after=2015-01-01.  
        You can also use after=2015-01-01 04:33:19 to be more precise with the range returned.

        This parameter is the account age (in epoch seconds) of the author of a submission or comment. This can be used to filter comments or
        submissions based on the age of the author account. This parameter works much like the before and after parameters. Valid types of

aggregation:
    description: |
        The agg parameter allows you to perform aggregations across a specific field. For example, if you pass aggregation=author
        with your request, you will receive aggregations on authors for comments or submissions based on whatever other parameters
        you supply. Here are a few examples:

        To get the top authors across the past three days who have used the term "Trump" in a comment:
        
        https://api.pushshift.io/reddit/comment/search/?q=trump&after=3d&aggregation=author

        To get the number of comments mentioning "universe" by day over the past 30 days:

        https://api.pushshift.io/reddit/comment/search/?q=universe&after=30d&aggregation=created_utc&frequency=1d

        To get the top subreddits over the past 7 days that have mentioned "Overwatch":

        https://api.pushshift.io/reddit/comment/search/?q=overwatch&after=7d&aggregation=subreddit

    type: string
    valid objects: comment,submission

aggs:
    description: |
        (deprecated) Alias for aggregation.  Please use aggregation instead of aggs.

    alias to: aggregation

frequency:
    description: |
        This is used in conjunction with the aggs parameter when aggs=created_utc. This determines the window size when returning
        an aggregation based on time. This accepts values in the format of number followed by (s,m,h,d) (seconds, minutes, hours, days). This 
        parameter also accepts values like (day,month,year).

        For example, to return the number of submissions mentioning games in the title aggregated by week, you can use a query like this:

        https://api.pushshift.io/reddit/submission/search/?title=games&aggs=created_utc&frequency=7d

    type: string

filter:
    description: |

        parameter to filter=author,created_utc,subreddit

sort:

        sort=id:desc (sort by id descending)

    type: string
    default: desc
    valid objects: comment,submission,subreddit

ensure_ascii:
    description: |
        This will ensure the returned JSON is ascii (7 bit) safe. All unicode characters besides ascii will be unicode encoded.
        Example:

        ensure_ascii=false beställningsjobb
        ensure_ascii=true best\u00e4llningsjobb (ä has been encoded to \u00e4)

    type: boolean
    default: false
    valid objects: global

index:
    description: |
        This is an advanced parameter. On the back-end, multiple indexes are searched when a request is made. By specifying a 
        specific index, queries can usually run much faster and use less processing power. Indexes are named in a quarterly
        fashion. For example:

        rc_2018-q01 (First quarter 2018 index for comments)
        rs_2016-q03 (Third quarter 2016 index for submissions)

        When doing searches for comments, the default is to use the "rc" index, which is an alias for all comment indexes. When
        searching submissions, the default index is "rs".

    type: string
    valid objects: global

aggregation.shard_size:
    description: |
        This can be used with some term aggregations (like subreddit or author) to help reduce the doc_count_error_upper_bound
